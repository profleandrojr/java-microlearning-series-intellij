# Java Microlearning Series

This repository contains the source code and educational materials for the **Java Microlearning Series**.

The project is a collection of short, concept-driven Java lessons designed to build strong mental models through theory, visual explanations, and hands-on practice.

The primary distribution channel for this course is the **JetBrains Marketplace**, where lessons are consumed directly inside the IDE.

This repository exists for:
- transparency
- version control
- educational reference
- long-term maintenance of the course content

## Repository Structure

This project is split into two repositories:

- This repository contains the public course description, policies, and educational overview.
- The IDE-specific source code used to build the JetBrains course is maintained in a separate repository for technical clarity and maintainability.

## Structure

- `Course IntelliJ/`
