summary: |
  Java Microlearning Series is a collection of short, concept-driven lessons designed to build strong mental models in Java.

  Each lesson focuses on a single core concept and is structured as a microlecture followed by practical tasks that gradually increase in depth. The goal is not memorization, but understanding how Java works under the hood.

  This course is ideal for beginners, self-taught developers, and educators who want clear explanations, real code examples, and exercises that reinforce fundamental Java concepts.
